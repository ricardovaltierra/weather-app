## How it Works

This webpage is built with pure Javascript, it needs Webpack to proper use because has various imports of code and it has various little helper functions. All of the resources (images, fonts) and .js files are located inside `/src` folder.

### Running the code

It is just required to build on top to have an account and credentials for the following API's:

* [Algolia Places](https://community.algolia.com/)
* [Aeris Weather](https://www.aerisweather.com/)

Both are free for usage. Once done just fill the credentials on `src/credentials.json`.


*   Navigate to the root directory of the project

*   Run this command on your terminal to add all the required packages and dependencies
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
*   Now you can run with webpack and play with it
    ```
    $ npm run watch
    ```
